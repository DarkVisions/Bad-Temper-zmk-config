# Bad Temper ZMK Config

This is my hack of a ZMK config for the [Bad Temper](https://github.com/essFitt/Bad-Temper) by [EssFit](https://github.com/essFitt).

Some notes about this config:
- it incorporates a bunch of config from urob's Timeless Home Row Mods.
- it does this very badly, and any faults are mine, not his
- Four main layers (default, numbers/symbols, navigation, and function)
- Default layer is Colemak DHm, but there's also a QWERTY layer that can be toggled on
- Navigation layer has vim-like arrow keys
